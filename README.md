# savefiles

For Windows most of the saves end up in:
```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local
```

For Debian-based Linux distributions:
```
$HOME/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata
```

And each game directory has its own path similar to the Windows equivalent:
```
pfx/drive_c/useres/steamuser/AppData
```
