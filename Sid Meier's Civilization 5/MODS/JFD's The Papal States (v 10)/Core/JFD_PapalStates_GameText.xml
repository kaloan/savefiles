			<Text>The Papal States was a political entity that existed on the Italian peninsula from the 500s AD until 1870, when it was usurped by the unification of Italy by the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. It is unique in that it was under the indirect sovereignty of the Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Throughout it's history, the Papal States has played a significant role in balancing the power of Europe and is arguably one of the most important European nations to have ever existed; being directly and indirectly responsible for such history-changing events as the colonization of the New World by the Spanish, the Counter-Reformation and the formation of the Holy Roman Empire.</Text>

			<Text>Pius IX was the head of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign of the Papal States in the late nineteenth century. He was the longest serving Roman Pontiff since Saint Peter, reigning for some 32 years. During his pontificate, Pius IX oversaw the convention of the First Vatican Council, which would declare Papal Infallibility, and which would centralized the Catholic Church within the Vatican. He would also decree the Immaculate Conception; formally recognising that Mary, Mother of God, was born without Original Sin. Much of Pius' reign would be interrupted by the threat of Italian nationalists on Rome, who eventually aided in the usurpation of the Papal States in the unification of Italy. Despite this, Pius IX resisted the invaders, refusing to bow to the Italian government, and, as prisoner within the Vatican, remained faithful and persevering; owing to the continuation of the Holy See.</Text>

			<Text>Praises to you, most blessed Pius IX, Bishop of Rome and Servant of the Servants of God. Marked by the trials of the aftermath of France's scourge upon Europe, your Pontificate would be the longest served since that of Saint Peter, and throughout you would tirelessly champion the long-held ways of Europe in the face of gripping nationalism and modernity. As Supreme Pontiff, you would oversee the convention of the First Vatican Council, where Papal Infallibility would be declared, and the central government of the Papacy and the Catholic Church would be formalised upon the Vatican within Rome. Even despite the usurpation of your temporal power by the irreverent Italian nationalists, your faith and perseverance would ensure the survival of the Holy See well into the 20th century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oh holy father, the time has come for the pillars of your faith to once more bear the sacred being of your papacy. Can you take upon your shoulders the will of God to lead the faithful? Can you spread the light of His Holy Mother Church against the darkness that gripes this age? Can you build a civilization that stands the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>Swiss Guards describe, historically, the mercenaries who from Switzerland sought to serve as bodyguards throughout courts of Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Lauded for their enduring loyalty and bravery, Swiss Guards served a wide variety of functions: from ceremonial guards to front-line troops, and were in use by the armies of some of Europe's greatest powers: including France, Spain and Naples. Although in 1874 the recruitment of Swiss Guards by foreign powers was forbidden by the Swiss Constitution, the Pontifical Swiss Guard that served the Holy See was an exception, and today remains the primary force of the Vatican; responsible for the safety of the Pope and the security of the Apostolic Palace.</Text>

			<Text>A chapel is a religious place of fellowship, prayer and worship that is attached to a larger, often nonreligious institution or that is considered an extension of a primary religious institution. It may be part of a larger structure or complex, such as a college, hospital, palace, prison, funeral home, church, synagogue or mosque, located on board a military or commercial ship, or it may be an entirely free-standing building, sometimes with its own grounds. Many military installations have chapels for the use of military personnel, normally under the leadership of a military chaplain. Until the Protestant Reformation, a chapel denoted a place of worship that was either at a secondary location that was not the main responsibility of the local parish priest, or that belonged to a person or institution. Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars, which if they occupied a distinct space, would often be called a chapel. Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship, they are also commonly found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily connote a specific denomination. Non-denominational chapels are commonly encountered as part of a non-religious institution such as a hospital, airport, university, prison or military installation.</Text>

This building may be constructed three times in any city, each possessing a unique Great Work slot that generates additional [ICON_PEACE] Faith for the city when filled. The second Chapel requires the city to have at least 7 followers of your main religion in order to be built, whilst the third requires at least 14 followers. Each Chapel requires the last. However, Chapels by themselves yield slightly less [ICON_PEACE] Faith and retain the same maintenance cost as a regular Temple.</Text>
