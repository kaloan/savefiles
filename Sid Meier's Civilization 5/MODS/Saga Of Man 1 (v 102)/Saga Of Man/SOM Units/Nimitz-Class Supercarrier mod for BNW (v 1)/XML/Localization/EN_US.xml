			<Text>The Supercarrier is a specialized vessel which carries fighter airplanes, bombers (but not stealth bombers), and atomic bombs. The Supercarrier itself is unable to attack, but the aircraft it carries make it the most powerful offensive weapon afloat. Defensively, the Supercarrier is much stronger than its predecessor, but should still be escorted by destroyers and submarines.</Text>

			<Text>The Nimitz-class supercarriers are a class of ten nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in service with the United States Navy. The lead ship of the class is named for World War II United States Pacific Fleet commander Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the U.S. Navy's last fleet admiral. With an overall length of 1,092 ft (333 m) and full-load displacements of over 100,000 long tons, they have been the largest warships built and in service, although they are being eclipsed by the upcoming Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers.</Text>
