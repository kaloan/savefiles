			<Text>Overlooking the waters of the Bosphorous, Topkapi Palace is a large palace complex located on the European side of Istanbul, Turkey. It was constructed under the orders of Mehmed II "The Conqueror", under whom the city was captured from the Byzantines and renamed Istanbul, as part of a scheme to re-build the city following the sucessful Ottoman siege. The palace served as the official residence of the Ottoman sultans for nearly four centuries of their rule, lasting until Sultan Abdul Mecid I moved the court to a newly-built palace further up the Bosphorous in 1856. Topkapi Palace is in fact more of a walled village than a palace, with several small buildings and many courtyards as opposed to one central structure. The site is home to many relics and artefacts collected both by the Sultans and following the end of the Ottoman empire when the palace was turned into a Museum. Among these are relics sacred to the Islamic world, including a door to the Great Mosque of Mecca, as well as what is said to be the cloak and sword of the prophet Muhammed. Other items include many collected from Silk Road trade, such as various pieces of Chinese porcelain from across four different dynasties of rule, and a collection of Islamic weaponry spanning approximately 13 centuries. Although the palace is largely still intact, some parts have since been lost as a result of either Earthquakes or fire.</Text>
