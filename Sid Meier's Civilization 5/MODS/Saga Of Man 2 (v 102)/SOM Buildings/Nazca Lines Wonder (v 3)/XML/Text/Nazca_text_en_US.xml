			<Text>The Nazca Lines, located between the Peruvian towns of Nazca and Palpa, are a series of enormous Geoglyphs designed on a large plateau, spanning over 80 kilometres. The designs have long been a source of mystery for those who have gazed upon them. It is estimated that the lines were constructed by the Nazca culture, hense the name, between 450 and 600 CE. The level of complexity of design varies between designs. Some are simple lines hundreds of metres long, while others are incredibly complex patterns resembling a variety of zoological designs - Monkeys, Condors, Spiders and Orca (Killer whale) to name but a few. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The Nazca Lines are particularily popular amongst circles which believe in the existance of extra-terrestrial life, which the Nazca culture mistook for their gods. They believe that the simpler, straight lines are in fact landing strips for interstellar crafts used by the extra-terrestrials to land, and that a humanoid figure represented in the patterns is one of the extraterrestrials. Modern science has had a range of theories, amongst which the lines serving a purpose similar to that of Stonehenge as an early form of an observatory / astronomical calendar. However, to this day the exact purpose of the lines remains a mystery.</Text>
