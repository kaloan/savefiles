			<Text>Teotihuacan is the name given to a vast complex in central Mexico. The early history of Teotihuacan is quite mysterious, and the origin of its founders is uncertain. It is most famous for the Pyramid of the Sun, the Pyramid of the Moon, and the Avenue of the Dead, three regions of the complex. However, Teotihuacan is also known for a series of colourful murals, and a type of pottery made in the complex which spread throughout Mesoamerica. Teotihuacan reached it's height at circa. 400 CE, before declining and dying out long before the Spanish arrival.</Text>
