			<Text> A military exoskeleton, also known as powered armor or an exoframe, is a powered mobile machine worn by a soldier in lieu of traditional body armor. It consists typically of armoured plating and electronic servos to aid in motion and enhance the user's strength.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the size of these exoskeletons can vary, a bipedal humanoid form is the most common configuration used, so as to utilise the innate spatial awareness of the human operator. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Due to the additional strength the suit provides, a wide range of weaponry can be employed by the user, from traditional small arms to larger ordnance  previously only usable by larger vehicles or tanks. As a result, the line of distinction between powered armor and bipedal vehicles (mechas) is very vague.</Text>

			<Text>The first attempt to place a weapon into outer space was taken by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. The scientists of the regime theorized a 'Sun Gun', a large concave mirror which could concentrate and reflect the sun's rays onto a small area on the Earth's surface, burning the target area. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Most of the later designs for Orbital Weapons were made during the Cold War by Soviet Russia and the United States. The Soviets proposed a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System that involved placing a nuclear warhead into low Earth orbit, which could then de-orbit to strike a target.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Outer Space and SALT II Treaties prohibited the use of outer space for any weapons of mass destruction, but does not restrict conventional weapons or techniques such as kinetic bombardment or space to earth laser systems. A growing number of private groups and government officials across the world have proposed a Space Preservation Treaty to ban the placement of any weaponry into outer space.</Text>

			<Text>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot on board. Its flight is either controlled autonomously by computers in the vehicle, or under the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. There are a wide variety of drone shapes, sizes, configurations, and characteristics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircraft, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed. They are predominantly deployed for military applications, but also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as fire-fighting and non-military security work, such as surveillance of pipelines. UAVs are often preferred for missions that are too 'dull, dirty, or dangerous' for manned aircraft.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A UAV's greatest advantage and disadvantage is the lack of a human pilot. As a physical human presence is not required, a UAV can be smaller and lighter than manned aircraft, and capable of manoeuvres that would disable a human pilot with g-force's effect on the body.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The drawback of not having a human pilot stems from a moderate detachment of human morality and intuition from the operation of a UAV, even when it is under remote control, leading to poor judgment and pilot error in high-stress situations. This is being remedied by research in more advanced artificial intelligence capable of weighing risks and introducing a moral component into logical calculations.</Text>

			<Text>Permanent human habitation on a planetary body other than the Earth is one of science fiction's most prevalent themes. As technology has advanced, and concerns about the future of humanity on Earth have increased, the argument that space colonization is an achievable and worthwhile goal has gained momentum. Because of its proximity to Earth, the Moon has been seen as the most obvious natural expansion after Earth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Placing a colony on another planet or celestial body would provide an ample source of resources for construction of both buildings and objects such as rockets, radiation shielding and any other necessities or materials required for life on the planet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the Moon's gravitational field is much smaller than Earth's, the energy required to launch an object into outer space is far lower than if a similar feat were attempted on Earth. This means that any traditional rockets launched would require far less fuel to leave the Moon, and opens up the possibility of using a railgun to launch an object from the Moon without the need for chemical propellants at all.</Text>

One of the major limiting factor in sending a payload into orbit is the mass of the payload, shortly followed by the drag due to the shape of the rocket. As such, the components used in rocket and satellite construction needed to be small and light, but without sacrificing any of their functional ability or resistance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This area of research, although not seeming to have any initial tangible economic significance, bore fruits in the development of new, smaller, lighter, and tougher materials and alloys than ever before; enriching further technological advances and ventures.</Text>

Space Research is the natural progression of this idea - to go from merely observing from a distance, to actually going there to witness it close-up.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Before the 1950s, the idea of going into outer space was reserved for science-fiction writings and religious postulation, but after the German scientists in the Second World War performed extensive research into rocketry, the gate was unlocked to making these dreams of space exploration a reality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the reasons for going to space are numerous - scientific curiosity, planning for the future of mankind, and military strategy - are by far the most dominant. Indeed, one of the bases of the initial Space Race was a competition by proxy between the USSR and the USA during the Cold War, each trying to outdo each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The commonly accepted boundaries for the Space Race start when the USSR's Sputnik I was the first man-made object to orbit the Earth on 4th October 1957, and end with the American Apollo 11 landing on the moon on 20th July 1969.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eventually, the focus of Space Scientists shifted from individual, one-off flights to reusable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle, and after the end of the Cold War, co-operation became key, with the International Space Station being a jewel in the crown of global co-operation.</Text>

Minerals could be mined from an asteroid or comet that passes near Earth, then brought back or used in space to construct spaceships or satellites off-Earth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Materials that could be mined or extracted include heavy metals for construction, water and oxygen to sustain the lives of any prospector-astronauts on site, as well as hydrogen for use as rocket fuel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In space exploration, using resources gathered whilst on a journey is referred to as in-situ resource utilization. Due to the thrust required to take pre-built objects or raw materials from Earth into space, it is often more efficient to send extraction equipment and simply mine the materials off-planet and construct the more massive components there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition, elements or materials seen as rare on Earth, such as gold or diamonds, can be found in abundance on other celestial bodies, so the potential to mine extra-terrestrial bodies purely for economic reasons is tangible for future development.</Text>

			<Text>The first oil refinery in the world was built in 1851 at Bathgate, Scotland, by Scottish chemist James Young shortly followed by Ignacy Lukasiewicz near Jaslo, Poland from 1854 to 1856, but they were initially small as there was no real demand for refined fuel. As Lukasiewicz's kerosene lamp gained popularity, the refining industry grew in the area. The world's first large refinery opened at Ploiești, Romania, in 1856-1857, with United States investment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After being taken over by Nazi Germany, the Ploiești refineries were bombed in Operation Tidal Wave by the Allies during the Oil Campaign of World War II. Another early large refinery is Oljeön, Sweden (1875) (Swedish name means The Petroleum Isle), now preserved as a museum near Engelsberg Ironworks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the Ekomuseum Bergslagen.</Text>

			<Text>A foundry is a factory that produces metal castings. Metals are cast into shapes by melting them into a liquid, pouring the metal in a mold, and removing the mold material or casting after the metal has solidified as it cools. The most common metals processed are aluminium and cast iron. However, other metals, such as bronze, brass, steel, magnesium, and zinc, are also used to produce castings in foundries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The introduction of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the advent of speedier and thriftier production methods, steel has become easier to obtain and much cheaper. Iron and steel are used widely in the construction of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Other common applications include shipbuilding, pipelines, mining, offshore construction, aerospace, white goods (e.g. washing machines), heavy equipment such as bulldozers, office furniture, steel wool, tools, and armour in the form of personal vests or vehicle armour.</Text>

			<Text>A biofuel is a fuel that stores energy from recent (geologically speaking) carbon fixation, the biological process that occurs when plants grow. The plant is chemically broken down and the resultant biofuel is used in specially designed engines or turbines to generate power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Solid biofuels have been in use ever since man discovered fire, in the form of wood. As fire was so integral to man's development, enabling cooking of food and the provision of heat and light, it is natural to assume that biofuel remained in use.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the discovery of electricity, biofuels fell into relative disuse in the developed world, in favour of the efficiency fossil fuels could offer. In today's society, increasing oil and fossil fuel prices have driven countries to seek more renewable and more stable alternatives.</Text>
