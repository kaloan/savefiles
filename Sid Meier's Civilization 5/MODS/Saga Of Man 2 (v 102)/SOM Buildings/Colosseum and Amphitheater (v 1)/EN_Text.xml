			<Set Text="The Greeks invented theatre as it is known in the West today. The original theatres were open-air amphitheatres often constructed on the side of a hill. The audience sat on benches cut into the hill, while the performers worked on an open stage at the foot of the hill. Over time the stages moved indoors (especially in locations with risks of lots of inclement weather). A modern theatre still has a stage and seats for the audience, but it also includes sophisticated sound and lighting equipment, an orchestra pit, and an extensive backstage area for props and scenery. Still, an ancient theatre-goer would not be totally surprised by anything found within a modern theatre (except possibly the cost of the food and drinks sold during intermission)."/>

			<Set Text="An Arena is an indoor or outdoor building designed for open-air sporting events, as well as theatrical performances and concerts. The term comes from the latin word 'harena' (sand), the central sandy area of an amphitheater. The ancient Romans in particular are known for the hundreds of amphitheatres they constructed, in which gladiatorial combat, exhibitions, and public executions were conducted."/>
