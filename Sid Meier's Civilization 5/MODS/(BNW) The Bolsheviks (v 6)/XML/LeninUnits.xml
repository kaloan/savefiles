			<Text>Though it comes late in the game, the Red Infantry can be plenty useful for holding off invasions. The Red Infantry gains a combat bonus while fighting on Railroad tiles, so a good means of keeping your units strong is to plop them on any tile with a Railroad. You may wish to also send a Worker with the Red Infantry in case you need to repair any pillaged Railroad tiles.</Text>
