			<Civilopedia>Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown, food preparation of cacao seeds, roasted and ground, often flavored, as with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste or in a block or used as a flavoring ingredient in other sweet foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mexico and Central America. A chocolatier is a person who makes confectionery from chocolate. Chocolatiers are distinct from chocolate makers, who create chocolate from cacao beans and other ingredients.</Civilopedia>
			<Strategy>The Chocolatier can only be constructed in a city with an improved cocoa resource nearby. The Chocolatier increases the [ICON_FOOD] Food and [ICON_CULTURE] Culture output of each such resource the city has access to. +15% of [ICON_FOOD] Food is carried over after a new [ICON_CITIZEN] Citizen is born.</Strategy>
			<Help>Each source of [ICON_RES_COCOA] Cocoa worked by this City produces +1 [ICON_FOOD] Food and +1 [ICON_CULTURE] Culture. +15% of [ICON_FOOD] Food is carried over after a new [ICON_CITIZEN] Citizen is born.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City must have at least one [ICON_RES_COCOA] Cocoa resource worked nearby.</Help>
