			<Civilopedia>Tanning is the process of treating skins of animals to produce leather, which is more durable and less susceptible to decomposition. Traditionally, tanning used tannin, an acidic chemical compound from which the tanning process draws its name (tannin is in turn named after an old German word for oak or fir trees, from which the compound was derived). Coloring may occur during tanning. A tannery is the term for a place where the skins are processed.</Civilopedia>
			<Strategy>The Tannery can only be constructed in a city with improved furs or dyes resources nearby. The Tannery increases the [ICON_GOLD] Gold output of each such resource the city has access to.</Strategy>
			<Help>Each source of [ICON_RES_FUR] Furs and [ICON_RES_DYE] Dyes and worked by this City produces +2 [ICON_GOLD] Gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City must have at least one of these resources worked nearby.</Help>
