			<Description>Weavery</Description>
			<Civilopedia>Weaving is a method of fabric production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them.</Civilopedia>
			<Strategy>The Weavery can only be constructed in a city with improved cotton or silk resources nearby. The Weavery increases the [ICON_GOLD] Gold output of each such resource the city has access to.</Strategy>
			<Help>Each source of [ICON_RES_COTTON] Cotton and [ICON_RES_SILK] Silk worked by this City produces +2 [ICON_GOLD] Gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City must have at least one of these resources worked nearby.</Help>
