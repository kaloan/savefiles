			<Description>Wine Cellar</Description>
			<Civilopedia>A wine cellar is a storage room for wine in bottles or barrels. An aboveground wine cellar is often called a wine room, while a small wine cellar (fewer than 500 bottles) is sometimes termed a wine closet. The household department responsible for the storage, care and service of wine in a great mediaeval house was termed the buttery. Large wine cellars date back over 3700 years.</Civilopedia>
			<Strategy>The Wine Cellar can only be constructed in a city with an improved wine resource nearby. The Wine Cellar increases the [ICON_FOOD] Food and [ICON_CULTURE] Culture output of each such resource the city has access to.</Strategy>
			<Help>Each source of [ICON_RES_WINE] Wine worked by this City produces +1 [ICON_FOOD] Food and +1 [ICON_CULTURE] Culture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City must have at least one [ICON_RES_WINE] Wine resource worked nearby.</Help>
